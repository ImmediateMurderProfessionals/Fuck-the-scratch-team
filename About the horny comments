Shut the fuck up H the server

They were not on the profiles of anyone under 18

They were on random accounts whose usernames were the same as the names of certain fictional characters that I want to fuck (those are all over 18 i think, with one possible exception)

Those comments were not serious and I will likely not comment them again when I get my main banned in 11 1/2 months.

Format for examples: 
https://scratch.mit.edu/users/username (character of same name that i want to fuck)

Example: https://scratch.mit.edu/users/husk/ (husk from hazbin hotel)
Example 2: https://scratch.mit.edu/users/verosika/ (verosika from helluva boss)
Example 3: https://scratch.mit.edu/users/sirpentious/ (sir pentious from hazbin hotel)
Example 4: https://scratch.mit.edu/users/shiver/ (shiver from splatoon 3
